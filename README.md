### 🎛️ Guided Mode

Want to customize what gets installed? Use the interactive TUI wizard:

```bash
atv-installer init --guided
```

Select your stack, toggle individual component layers on/off with checkboxes:

```
┃ What's your primary stack?
┃ > TypeScript
┃   Python
┃   Rails
┃   General
┃
┃ Which components do you want?
┃ > [•] Core pipeline skills (brainstorm, plan, work, review, compound)
┃   [•] Orchestrators (lfg, slfg)
┃   [•] Universal agents (security, performance, architecture, ...)
┃   [•] Stack-specific agents (language reviewers)
┃   [•] MCP servers (GitHub, Azure, Terraform, Context7)
┃   [•] VS Code extensions.json
┃   [•] Copilot instructions
┃   [•] Copilot setup steps
┃   [•] File-scoped instructions (applyTo globs)
┃   [•] docs/ structure
┃   [ ] Compound engineering local config
```

**Note:** The guided TUI requires a proper terminal (Windows Terminal, iTerm, etc.). The VS Code integrated terminal may not render Unicode box-drawing characters correctly.

### 🔄 Idempotent Re-runs

Run it again any time — existing files are skipped, new content is added, JSON configs are merged:

```
  Skipped 37 existing files
  Merged 2 JSON configs
  Created 2 files, 0 directories
```

## 🔬 Compound Engineering Pipeline

The ATV Starter Kit includes the **compound-engineering** multi-agent pipeline:

### `/lfg` (sequential) and `/slfg` (swarm/parallel)

These are the "run everything" entry points. The pipeline is:

```
  brainstorm → plan → deepen → work → review → fix → test → video → compound
       💭        📋      🔍       🔨     👀      🔧     🧪      🎬       📚
```

| # | Step | What it does |
|---|------|--------------|
| 1 | `/ce-brainstorm` | Explore WHAT to build (optional, user-driven) |
| 2 | `/ce-plan` | Create a structured plan document |
| 3 | `/deepen-plan` | Enrich plan sections with parallel research agents |
| 4 | `/ce-work` | Execute the plan (write code, tests, commits) |
| 5 | `/ce-review` | Multi-agent code review (security, perf, architecture) |
| 6 | `/resolve-todos` | Fix findings from review in parallel |
| 7 | `/test-browser` | Browser-based testing |
| 8 | `/feature-video` | Record a walkthrough, attach to PR |
| 9 | `/ce-compound` | Document what you learned for future sessions |

> Each step has a **GATE** — the pipeline won't advance until the prior step produces its artifact.

## 🧠 The 5 Core Skills

### 1. `ce-brainstorm` — "What should we build?"

- Interactive dialogue using `AskUserQuestion` to clarify requirements
- Runs `repo-research-analyst` to understand existing patterns
- Produces a brainstorm document in `docs/brainstorms/`
- Assesses whether brainstorming is even needed (clear requirements skip it)
- Hands off to `/ce-plan`

### 2. `ce-plan` — "How do we build it?"

- Checks for existing brainstorm docs and uses them as primary input
- Runs **parallel research agents**: `repo-research-analyst`, `learnings-researcher`, optionally `best-practices-researcher` + `framework-docs-researcher`
- Makes a **risk-based research decision** — security/payments always get external research; strong local context skips it
- Runs `spec-flow-analyzer` to validate user flows and edge cases
- Outputs a plan in `docs/plans/` with YAML frontmatter, acceptance criteria, and checkboxes

### 3. `ce-work` — "Execute the plan"

- Reads the plan, breaks it into a todo list
- Sets up git branches (supports worktrees for parallel dev)
- Implements task-by-task with a **System-Wide Test Check** table (callbacks, mocks, orphaned state, error alignment)
- Makes **incremental commits** at logical boundaries
- Checks off plan items as they're completed (`[ ]` → `[x]`)
- Optionally runs Figma design sync for UI work
- Quality checks with configurable reviewer agents before finishing

### 4. `ce-review` — "Multi-perspective code review"

- Configurable via `compound-engineering.local.md` (created by `/setup`)
- Launches **parallel review agents** (e.g., security-sentinel, performance-oracle, architecture-strategist, code-simplicity-reviewer, language-specific reviewers like kieran-rails-reviewer)
- Has **conditional agents** that only fire for specific PR types (database migrations trigger schema-drift-detector + data-migration-expert + deployment-verification-agent)
- "Ultra-thinking" deep dive with stakeholder perspective analysis (developer, ops, end user, security, business)
- Supports `--serial` mode for long sessions to avoid context limits

### 5. `ce-compound` — "Document what we learned"

- Captures recently-solved problems into `docs/solutions/` with YAML frontmatter
- Launches 5 parallel sub-agents: Context Analyzer, Solution Extractor, Related Docs Finder, Prevention Strategist
- Has a **context budget check** — warns if the session is too long and offers a compact-safe mode
- Creates searchable institutional knowledge that future sessions consume via `learnings-researcher`

## 🤖 The Agent Roster (28 Specialized Agents)

The `.github/agents/` directory contains **28 `.agent.md` files**, each a specialized persona:

| Category | Agents |
|----------|--------|
| **Code Review** | `kieran-rails-reviewer`, `kieran-python-reviewer`, `kieran-typescript-reviewer`, `dhh-rails-reviewer`, `code-simplicity-reviewer`, `julik-frontend-races-reviewer` |
| **Security** | `security-sentinel` (OWASP, input validation, secrets) |
| **Architecture** | `architecture-strategist` (SOLID, coupling, boundaries) |
| **Performance** | `performance-oracle` (Big-O, DB queries, memory, scaling) |
| **Data** | `data-integrity-guardian`, `data-migration-expert`, `schema-drift-detector`, `deployment-verification-agent` |
| **Design** | `design-implementation-reviewer`, `design-iterator`, `figma-design-sync` |
| **Research** | `repo-research-analyst`, `best-practices-researcher`, `framework-docs-researcher`, `learnings-researcher`, `git-history-analyzer` |
| **Process** | `pr-comment-resolver`, `spec-flow-analyzer`, `bug-reproduction-validator`, `pattern-recognition-specialist` |
| **Meta** | `agent-native-reviewer` (ensures features are agent-accessible), `ankane-readme-writer` |
| **Ops** | `lint` |

## 🏗️ Key Design Patterns

### 1. Parallel Sub-Agent Orchestration

Nearly every step spawns multiple agents simultaneously. `/ce-plan` runs research agents in parallel. `/ce-review` runs all reviewers in parallel. `/ce-compound` runs 5 extractors in parallel. `/slfg` even parallelizes review + browser testing.

### 2. Living Documents as State

Plans in `docs/plans/` serve as shared state. `/ce-plan` creates them, `/deepen-plan` enriches them, `/ce-work` checks off items, `/ce-review` protects them from deletion. Brainstorms in `docs/brainstorms/` feed into plans. Solutions in `docs/solutions/` feed back into future planning.

### 3. Knowledge Compounding Loop

This is the signature pattern:

```
solve problem → /ce-compound documents it → docs/solutions/
                                                    ↓
future /ce-plan → learnings-researcher searches docs/solutions/ → avoids past mistakes
```

### 4. Configurable Per-Project

The `setup` skill auto-detects your stack (Rails, Python, TypeScript, etc.) and writes `compound-engineering.local.md` with the right reviewer agents. This means `/ce-review` and `/ce-work` adapt to any project.

### 5. Gate-Based Progression

`/lfg` enforces strict ordering with verification gates. No coding until a plan exists. No review until code exists. This prevents the common AI failure mode of jumping straight to implementation.

## ✨ Why ATV?

| | Feature | |
|---|---|---|
| 🔄 | **Full-lifecycle coverage** | Brainstorm through video demo — nothing is manual |
| 🧠 | **Institutional memory** | AI agents that learn from past sessions via the compound loop |
| 👀 | **Multi-perspective review** | 28 agents cover more angles than any human reviewer |
| 📊 | **Configurable depth** | MINIMAL / STANDARD / COMPREHENSIVE detail levels |
| 🛡️ | **Risk-aware research** | Always researches high-risk areas; skips when patterns are clear |

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Build
go build -o atv-installer .

# Run locally
./atv-installer init
./atv-installer init --guided

# Test in a sandbox
mkdir /tmp/test-project && cd /tmp/test-project
/path/to/atv-installer init
```

## ⚠️ Limitations & Considerations

- **Token-heavy pipeline** — running 5+ parallel agents in a long session can hit context limits
- **TUI requires proper terminal** — `--guided` mode needs Windows Terminal / iTerm / real TTY (not VS Code integrated terminal)
- **Assumes CLI tools** — MCP servers need Node.js (`npx`), GitHub operations need `gh` CLI
- **Opinionated docs structure** — creates `docs/plans/`, `docs/brainstorms/`, `docs/solutions/`
- **Originally Claude Code** — some skill patterns (Task tool, Bash commands) are Claude Code idioms that map approximately to Copilot
