## [2.5.7] — 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Karpathy Guidelines skill** — behavioral guardrails derived from [Andrej Karpathy's observations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876) on LLM coding pitfalls, ported from [forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills) (Claude Code plugin) to GitHub Copilot's instruction system. Installs as `.github/skills/karpathy-guidelines/SKILL.md` with four principles: Think Before Coding, Simplicity First, Surgical Changes, and Goal-Driven Execution.
- **Coding Guidelines TUI category** — new `📐 Coding Guidelines` category in the guided installer's customization screen. Karpathy Guidelines are included in all three presets (Starter, Pro, Full) as a core skill and can be toggled in the customize step.

## [2.5.6] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Training quest link in README** — added link to the [ATV Starter Kit Quest](https://blazingbeard.github.io/quests/atv-starterkit.html), a guided and gamified training experience by [blazingbeard](https://github.com/blazingbeard).

### Fixed

- **Suppressed noisy gstack output during guided install** — gstack's setup generates skills for every supported host (Cursor, Slate, OpenClaw, Kiro, Factory, OpenCode) then ATV prunes them. Previously all that per-file generation output and token budget tables leaked to stdout. Now subprocess output is captured silently — users see only the TUI spinner and final summary.
- **Copilot hooks hardened against missing node** — observer hook commands now suppress errors (`2>/dev/null || true` on bash, `try/catch` on PowerShell) so projects without Node.js don't get hook failures on every session.
- **Removed excessive observer hooks** — stripped `userPromptSubmitted`, `preToolUse`, `postToolUse`, and `errorOccurred` hooks that fired on every interaction. Only `sessionStart` and `sessionEnd` remain, reducing hook overhead.
- **Prune ordering fixed** — non-GitHub platform dirs are now pruned before copying skills (was after), preventing any chance of non-GitHub artifacts leaking into `.github/skills/`.

## [2.5.5] — 2026-04-09

### Added

- **`atv-installer uninstall` command** — cleanly removes all ATV-installed files from a project. Removes `.github/skills/`, `.github/agents/`, `.github/hooks/`, `.github/copilot-*` config files, `.gstack/`, `.atv/`, and empty doc directories. Preserves user-modified files by default (checksum comparison against install manifest). Use `--force` to remove everything.

## [2.5.3] — 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- **Prune non-GitHub platform dirs from gstack staging** — after cloning gstack, the installer now removes `.cursor/`, `.factory/`, `.kiro/`, `.openclaw/`, `.opencode/`, `.slate/`, `codex/`, `openclaw/`, `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `.github/`, `extension/`, `hosts/`, `contrib/`, `supabase/`, `test/`, `scripts/`, and `docs/` from `.gstack/`. These are gstack's multi-platform outputs (OpenClaw, OpenCode, Cursor, Kiro, Slate, Factory) and build artifacts that are irrelevant to GitHub Copilot users.

## [2.5.1] — 2026-04-07

### Changed

- **README overhauled** — eliminated repetitive sections (continuous learning explained 3x, installation covered 2x, guided installer described 3x), consolidated into a single-pass flow. Same details, no redundancy.
- **`/lfg` and `/slfg` pipeline diagrams added** — visual pipeline flows showing step order, parallel execution in `/slfg`, and where `/unslop` and `/ce-compound` fit
- **De-slop and memory sections tightened** — cut verbose pipeline diagrams and filler phrase tables; kept the core pitch and usage

## [2.5.0] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed

- **ce-brainstorm and brainstorming templates restored** — the compound-engineering update (v2.4.0) accidentally flattened both SKILL.md files into single lines, breaking YAML frontmatter parsing and making `/ce-brainstorm` undiscoverable. Both templates now have proper multi-line content with valid frontmatter.

### Changed

- **Learning pipeline skills renamed** — removed `atv-` prefix from all learning pipeline skills for cleaner slash commands:
  - `atv-learn` → `learn` (`/learn`)
  - `atv-instincts` → `instincts` (`/instincts`)
  - `atv-evolve` → `evolve` (`/evolve`)
  - `atv-observe` → `observe` (`/observe`)
  - `atv-unslop` → `unslop` (`/unslop`)
- **`/lfg` workflow updated** — now includes `/observe` and `/learn` steps after `/unslop fix` to capture patterns from the completed work
- **`/slfg` workflow updated** — added a new Learning Phase with `/observe` and `/learn` between the Autofix Phase and Finalize Phase

## [2.0.1] — 2026-04-01

Patch release to fix npm distribution. The v2.0.0 npm package was published before any corresponding GitHub release with goreleaser binaries existed, so the postinstall binary download would fail. This release publishes a GitHub release for v2.0.1 with pre-built binaries and a matching npm version that resolves correctly via `releases/latest`.

### Fixed

- **npm install works end-to-end** — the latest GitHub release (v2.0.1) now ships goreleaser binaries for all platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows on amd64/arm64), and the npm package points installers at this release
- **Version alignment** — VERSION file, npm package, and GitHub release tag are now all in sync at 2.0.1

## [2.0.0] — 2026-03-29

ATV 2.0 — **All The Vibes** becomes a unified installer combining Compound Engineering, gstack, and agent-browser into one agentic coding setup for GitHub Copilot.

### Added

- **gstack integration** — 30 gstack skills from [garrytan/gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) installable via the guided wizard. Clone, generate docs, copy skills, and create runtime sidecar — all handled by the Go installer.
- **agent-browser integration** — [Vercel agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) installable via guided mode. Auto-installs the CLI via npm and downloads Chrome for Testing.
- **Preset-based guided wizard** — Three presets (Starter / Pro / Full) replace the flat checkbox list. Beginners pick a preset; power users drill into category-grouped customization.
- **Animated install progress** — Bubbletea-powered progress display with per-step spinners (pending → running → done/failed) replacing the silent line-by-line output.
- **Retro terminal banner** — "ALL THE VIBES 2.0" in block letters with gold gradient and retro boot messages, matching the hero SVG.
- **Runtime sidecar** — `.github/skills/gstack/` directory with binaries (`bin/`), browser runtime (`browse/dist/`), review checklists, and `ETHOS.md` so gstack skills can find their runtime assets.
- **Memory system documentation** — copilot-instructions templates now include ATV Override Rules and conflict resolution between ATV and gstack memory systems.
- **Function-based TUI categories** — Skills organized by what they do (Planning, Review, QA, Security, Shipping, Safety) instead of where they come from.
- **`pkg/gstack/`** — New Go package for gstack installation: prerequisite detection, git clone, skill doc generation, sidecar creation.
- **`pkg/agentbrowser/`** — New Go package for agent-browser: npm install, Chrome download, SKILL.md fetch.
- **`pkg/tui/presets.go`** — Preset definitions (Starter, Pro, Full) with skill mappings.
- **`pkg/tui/progress.go`** — Bubbletea progress model with animated spinners.
- **Sandbox integration tests** — `test/sandbox/` with tests for auto mode, guided mode, gstack install, idempotency, and instructions content.

### Changed

- **README** rewritten as "The Three Pillars" — Compound Engineering (knowledge compounds), gstack (AI sprint process), agent-browser (eyes of the agent). Memory highlighted as a first-class differentiator.
- **Wizard flow** — Stack → Preset → Customize? → (optional) multi-select instead of Stack → flat checkbox wall.
- **copilot-instructions templates** — all 4 stacks (general, typescript, python, rails) now include gstack skill listing, agent-browser section, and ATV Override Rules.
- **`.gitignore`** — added `.gstack/`, `.env`, `*.db`, `.claude/` entries.
- **`cmd/init.go`** — guided mode now runs gstack and agent-browser install steps with progress display; auto mode unchanged.
- **`pkg/output/printer.go`** — new status indicators (🔗 Cloned, 🔨 Built), gstack/agent-browser progress methods, dynamic next-steps with step numbering.

### Fixed

- **gstack skill discovery** — skills placed at `.github/skills/gstack-*/SKILL.md` (one level deep) instead of nested `.github/skills/gstack/{name}/SKILL.md` which Copilot couldn't discover.
- **Windows CRLF** — bash scripts in gstack clone are auto-fixed (`\r\n` → `\n`) before execution.
- **Preset cursor** — default to Starter so all three options are visible in shorter terminals.
